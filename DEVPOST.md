### **D&I Scoring Algorithm**
```
Score = 0.35×Affordability + 0.20×Accessibility + 0.20×Safety + 0.15×Commute + 0.10×Inclusivity
```

- **Affordability (35%)**: Rent, utilities, deposits vs. user budget
- **Accessibility (20%)**: Step-free entry, elevators, doorway width, accessible facilities
- **Safety (20%)**: Distance to campus, lighting, management hours
- **Commute (15%)**: Walk time, bus frequency, proximity to amenities
- **Inclusivity (10%)**: International student support, flexible requirements
